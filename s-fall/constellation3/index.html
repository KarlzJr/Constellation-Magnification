			Best seen in September at 9 p.m., Capricornus is one of the dimmer zodiac
			constellations, but because of its recognizable shape it's not too
			difficult to find. One method that is used to find Capricornus starts with
			finding the ecliptic line. During sunset, start by looking west towards
			the sunset and finding a bright red dot above the sun, which is Venus.
			The Moon should be rising in the opposite direction, and from there you
			trace or imagine a linear path from Venus to the Moon. If two hours after
			sunset, look east for a little red dot, which is Mars, and trace the
			linear path from Mars to the Moon. Looking towards the south of the sky,
			Capricornus is made of bright stars that form a triangle or boomerang
			shape, and the ecliptic line passes right through it. Another way to
			find Capricornus is to look for it’s neighbor Sagittarius, which has
			a recognizable shape of a teapot.<br>

			The constellation has its roots in the cultures of Sumeria — which
			identified it with a mythical figure that was half goat and half fish —
			and Babylonia, which portrayed it as a goat-human hybrid.(space.com)<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in finding
			the constellation:

			<ul>
				<li>Right Ascension: 21.02 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: -20 to -23 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible: between latitudes 60 degrees and -90 degrees</li>
			</ul>
