		<h1>Aries Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen in December around 9 p.m., Aries is a simple constellation
			composed of only four stars, but can be easily found if the stargazer can
			find Orion’s belt. Orion’s belt is made up of three stars in a straight
			line. Once found, extend an imaginary straight line from the belt that
			continues to Aldebaran, a bright star in the Taurus constellation.
			Continuing from the imaginary straight line is the Pleiades, a group of
			seven stars closely bunched together. Next to this bunch should be a
			bright star called Hamal, which makes up Aires.<br>

			Greeks and the Egyptians traditionally associated the constellation with
			a ram. In Greek mythology, the ram was golden and was sacrificed to Zeus,
			the Greek leader of the gods (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in finding
			the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right Ascension: 3 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: 20 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes 90 degrees and -60 degrees</li>
			</ul>
