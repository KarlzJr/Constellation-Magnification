				Best seen in October at 9 p.m, Aquarius is the tenth largest
				constellation in the night sky, but one of the harder ones to spot
				because of its lack of particularly bright stars. One method that is
				used to find Aquarius starts with finding the ecliptic line. During
				sunset, start by looking west towards the sunset and finding a bright
				red dot above the sun, which is Venus. The Moon should be rising in the
				opposite direction, and from there you trace or imagine a linear path
				from Venus to the Moon. If two hours after sunset, look east for a
				little red dot, which is Mars, and trace the linear path from Mars to
				the Moon. Since the rest of the zodiac constellations can be found on
				the ecliptic line, using Capricornus as a map reference will be useful
				in finding Aquarius. Looking towards the south of the sky, Capricornus
				is made of bright stars that form a triangle or boomerang shape, and
				the ecliptic line passes right through it. Next, find a group of three
				stars called Alpha Aquarii, Zeta Aquarii, and Gamma Aquarii, which form
				a tiny y-shape. That y-shape is a part of Aquarius.<br>

				The Greeks linked Aquarius with Ganymede, the cupbearer to the gods.
				According to lore, Ganymede was a good-looking young man who was the
				object of Zeus' affection and was brought to Mount Olympus, where he
				served as cupbearer to the gods and was granted eternal youth.

				For a moreexperienced star gazer, use the information below in finding
				the constellation:

				<ul>
						<li>Right Ascension: 22.71 hours</li>
						<li>Declination: -10.19 degrees</li>
						<li>Visible: Between 65 degrees and -90 degrees</li>
				</ul>
