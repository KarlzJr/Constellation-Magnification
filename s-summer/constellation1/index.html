			Best seen August around 9 p.m., Sagittarius is more difficult to find
			because of the low brightness of its stars and its central location to
			the Milky Way Galaxy, but because of its signature teapot shape, it can
			definitely be found with a few methods. In an area with minimal light
			pollution, use the Milky Way Galaxy to find Sagittarius. The Milky Way
			has a wider, brighter area and to the left of this area is the
			constellation. The second method requires finding the ecliptic path,
			which starts by looking west towards the sunset and finding a bright
			red dot above the sun, which is Venus. The Moon should be rising in the
			opposite direction, and from there you trace or imagine a linear path
			from Venus to the Moon. Look at the ecliptic path until you find
			Sagittarius and use the tail-end of Scorpius as a place marker for the
			constellation.<br>

			The Greeks identify Sagittarius as a centaur, horse-human hybrid with the
			body of a man atop the four legs of a horse. The creature is aiming an
			arrow toward its neighbor Scorpio (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in finding
			the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right ascension: 19.11 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: -25.8 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible: between 55 degrees and -90 degrees</li>
			</ul>
