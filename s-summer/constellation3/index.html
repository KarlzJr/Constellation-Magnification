		<h1>Libra Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen in June at 9 p.m, Libra is a simple shaped constellation that is
			better off found if using more recognizable constellations to navigate.
			First look for the Big Dipper. West of the Big Dipper, there is a
			constellation called Bootes that contains a yellowish, bright star called
			Arcturus. To find Arcturus, just simply imagine the curve of the Big
			Dipper handle to be extended until you find the midway point of Arcturus.
			Continue tracing or imagining the handle curvature from Arcturus, you will
			find Spica, the brightest star in Virgo. Once Spica is found,
			just look a	bit west on the ecliptic line for a set of stars that
			form a house shape.<br>

			Ancient Greeks knew the part of the sky occupied by the Libra
			constellation as Chelae, or “claws,” and considered it part of Scorpio
			constellation. Chelae represented the scorpion’s
			claws. (constellation-guide.com)<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in
			finding the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right Ascension: 15 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: minus 15 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes between 65 and minus 90</li>
			</ul>
