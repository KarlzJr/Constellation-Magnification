		<h1>Scorpius Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen in July at 9 p.m, Scorpius is one of the more challenging
			constellations to spot in the night sky. One method that is used to find
			Scorpius starts with finding the ecliptic line. During sunset, start by
			looking west towards the sunset and finding a bright red dot above the
			sun, which is Venus. The Moon should be rising in the opposite direction,
			and from there you trace or imagine a linear path from Venus to the Moon.
			If two hours after sunset, look east for a little red dot, which is Mars,
			and trace the linear path from Mars to the Moon. Once an ecliptic line is
			established, look for a slightly red bright star called Antares, which is
			right along the ecliptic line. This star is the heart of Scorpius.  Next,
			look for a tail shaped set of bright stars that resemble a hook. Within
			this hook should be a brighter star called Shaula.<br>

			In Greek mythology, Scorpius and Orion are often intertwined. According to
			one myth, Orion boasted that he would kill every animal on the earth. The
			goddess-hunter Artemis and her mother, Leto, released a scorpion to kill
			Orion. Zeus put the scorpion in the heavens after it won the
			battle (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in
			finding the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right Ascension: 17 hours<li>
				<li>Declination: minus 40 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes 40 and minus 90 degrees</li>
