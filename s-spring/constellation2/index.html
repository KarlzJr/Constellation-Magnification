		<h1>Cancer Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen around March at 9 p.m, Cancer is known for being one of the
			oldest recognized groups of stars. However it is one of the trickiest to
			spot, so using the Big Dipper and the star Regulus from the Cancer
			constellation, you will look for two bright stars from the Gemini
			constellation, Castor and Pollux. In finding Pollux, trace an imaginary
			line diagonally from the handle of the Big Dipper towards the opposite
			side of itâ€™s bowl. Continuing that line, you should see Pollux and Castor
			above it. From there, split the difference between Leo and Gemini and look
			for a wishbone shaped constellation, with the Altarf star being the
			brightest. You have now found it!<br>

			The constellation of Cancer represents the giant crab that attacked
			Hercules during the second of the 12 labors he performed as penance for
			killing his family (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in finding
			the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right ascension: 9 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: 20 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes 90 degrees and minus 60 degrees</li>
			</ul>
