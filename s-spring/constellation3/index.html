		<h1>Virgo Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen in May at 9 p.m, Virgo is a more simple constellation to spot in
			the night sky. First look for the Big Dipper. West of the Big Dipper,
			there is a constellation called Bootes that contains a yellowish, bright
			star called Arcturus. To find Arcturus, just simply imagine the curve of
			the Big Dipper handle to be extended until you find the midway point of
			Arcturus. Continue tracing or imagining the handle curvature from
			Arcturus, you will find Spica, the brightest star in Virgo. It resembles
			the left hand of the constellation, and continue looking a bit Northeast
			of Spica for a bright star called Porrima which is the heart of the
			constellation.<br>

			The constellation Virgo is usually associated with the Greek goddess of
			justice, Dike. Dike was the daughter of Zeus and Greek Titaness Themis.
			Virgo is usually depicted with angel-like wings, with an ear of wheat in
			her left hand, marked by the bright star Spica.
