			Best seen in February around 9 p.m, Gemini is one of the easiest zodiac
			constellations to find. One method is just simply locating the two of its
			brightest stars, Castor and Pollux, with help from the Big Dipper. In
			finding Castor and Pollux, trace an imaginary line diagonally from the
			handle of the Big Dipper towards the opposite side of it’s bowl.
			Continuing that line, you should see Pollux and Castor above it. These
			two stars represent each of the “twins” heads
			in the Gemini constellation.<br>

			In Egyptian astrology, the constellation was identified with twin goats,
			while Arabian astrology said it was twin peacocks. The Western world
			tends to identify these twins as Castor and Pollux from Greek
			mythology (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below in
			finding the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right ascension: 7 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: 20 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes 90 degrees and minus 60 degrees</li>
			</ul>
