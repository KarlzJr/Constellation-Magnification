		<h1>Taurus Constellation</h1>
		<div class="data">
			Best seen in January around 9 p.m, Taurus is one of the easiest zodiac
			constellations to find in the night sky. All that is needed is finding
			Orions’s belt or the Pleiades. Orion’s belt is made up of three stars in
			a straight line. Once found, extend an imaginary straight line from the
			belt that continues to Aldebaran, a bright star in the Taurus
			constellation. If Aldebaran can’t be seen, just simply look for the
			Pleiades, a group of seven stars closely bunched together. In between
			the Pleiades and Orion’s belt is Taurus, which is shaped like a Y with
			a hook.<br>

			In Greek mythology, when Zeus fell in love with the Phoenician Princess
			Europa, he transformed himself into a white bull with golden horns named
			Taurus and carried Europa away to Crete (space.com).<br>

			For a more experienced star gazer, use the information below
			in finding the constellation:
			<ul>
				<li>Right ascension: 4 hours</li>
				<li>Declination: 15 degrees</li>
				<li>Visible between latitudes 90 degrees and minus 65 degrees</li>
			</ul>
